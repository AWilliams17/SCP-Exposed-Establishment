## SCP Exposed Establishment - an SCPSL hack
This is my first time writing a cheat for a Unity game, and working with Unity in general. This also wasn't originally  
going to be open source but whatever. SCPSL is kind of bad.  

Anyway this is just a run of the mill hack. The primary feature is the ESP. There's no aimbot or fancy packet editing  
or wallhacks and what not.  

The only other function is what I call the PlayerScanner, which tells you how many players are left alive, and what  
their character class is.  

Here's the keybinds (no, there also isn't a fancy GUI that lets you change the binds and there probably won't be  
one in the future since I'm kind of tired of working on this. Like I said SCPSL is kind of (is) bad.)  
[Numpad 0]: Toggle the 'SCP Exposed Establishment' label in the upper right corner.  
[Numpad 1]: Toggle the aforementioned PlayerScanner.  
[Numpad 2]: Toggle the ESP.  
  
The ESP displays players(using their character class as the label + colors derived from the class), locations (SCP 913,  
PocketDimension exit teleporters, and elevators), and items of interest (being keycards and guns).  

I'll probably not add any new features to this since that would mean playing SCPSL, which I kind of don't want to do.
